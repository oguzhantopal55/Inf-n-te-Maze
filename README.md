This is a six person we made in one semester. The Project is Rogue-like Godot Game. The game produces each level in a procedural manner and also has boss sections at certain intervals. At the end of every level tha game gives certain amount of gold and player can buy stats with that gold.
Player can get into dialogues with NPC's and the game uses free assets and music for NPC and Bosses. The game isnt complete and it doesnt have all the features we promised in documents so this is more like a playable demo.
The more details such as use case, test case, scrum backlogs are in the Infinite-Maze.pdf.
The controls are: 
Move = Move Buttons, Attack = Tab, Market = M, Buy = 1,2,3,4,5, Dungeon door = Esc, Dialogue = Enter, Ä°nside Dungeon Door = Enter.
